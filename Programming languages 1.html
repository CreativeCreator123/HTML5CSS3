<h3><u>1.) Procedural programming languages </u></h3>

A <b>procedural language</b> is a computer programming language that follows, in order, a set of commands.
<br> Examples of computer procedural languages are <em>BASIC, C, FORTRAN, Java, and Pascal</em>.
Procedural languages are some of the common types of programming 
languages used by script and software programmers. They make use of functions, conditional statements, 
and variables to create programs that allow a computer to calculate and display a desired output.

<h3><u>2.)	Functional programming language</u></h3>

<p>

    <strong>Functional programming languages</strong> are specially designed to handle symbolic computation and list 
    processing applications. Functional programming is based on mathematical functions. Some of the
     popular functional programming languages include:<em>LISP, Python, Erlang, Haskell, Clojure</em>, etc

</p>





<ol style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li><b>Pure Functional Languages</b> ‚àí These types of functional languages support only the functional
    paradigms. For example ‚àí<em>Haskell</em></li>
<li><b>Impure Functional Languages</b>‚àí These types of functional languages support the functional paradigms
    and imperative style programming. For example ‚Äì <em>LISP</em></li>

</ol>

<h3><u>3.)	Scripting programming language.</u></h3>

<p>
    A <b>scripting language</b> or script language is a programming language for a runtime system that automates the execution of tasks
    that would otherwise be performed individually by a human operator.[1] Scripting languages are usually interpreted at runtime
    rather than compiled. Scripting languages are a popular family of programming languages that allow frequent tasks to be performed
    quickly. Early scripting languages were generally used for niche applications ‚Äì and as ‚Äúglue languages‚Äù for combining existing
    systems. With the rise of the World Wide Web, a range of scripting languages emerged for use on web servers. Since scripting
    languages simplify the processing of text, they are ideally suited to the dynamic generation of HTML pages. Examples include
    <em>PHP, ruby, groovy, perl, LUA,</em> etc.

   </tr>

<h3><u>4.)	Logic Programming language</u></h3>

<p>
    <b>Logic programming</b> is a programming paradigm which is largely based on formal logic. Any program written in a logic programming 
    language is a set of sentences in logical form, expressing facts and rules about some problem domain. It can also be described 
    as a computer programming paradigm where program statements express facts and rules about problems within a system of formal logic.
    Some logic programming languages, such as <em>Datalog</em> and <em>ASP</em> (Answer Set Programming), are purely declarative. They allow for 
    statements about what the program should accomplish, with no explicit step-by-step instructions on how to do so. Others, such as
    <em>Prolog</em>, are a combination of declarative and imperative.

    <table style="width: 100%;">

    <tr>
   <th>Logic language</th>
   <th>Year it was founded</th>
   <th>Founder</th>
    </tr>


    <tr>
  <td>Datalog</td>
  <td>1977</td>
  <td>Herv√© Gallaire and Jack Minker</td>
   </tr>

   <tr>
    <td>ASP</td>
    <td>1998</td>
    <td>David Frost</td>
     </tr>

     <tr>
        <td>Prolog</td>
        <td>1972</td>
        <td>Alain Colmerauer</td>
         </tr>

 </table>

<h3><u>5.)Object-Oriented Programming Language.</u></h3>

<p>

    <b>Object Oriented programming</b> (OOP) is a programming <strong>paradigm</strong> that relies on the concept of classes and objects. ... These
    functions are defined within the class and perform some action helpful to that specific type of object. For example, our Car
    class may have a method repaint that changes the color attribute of our car. In object-oriented programming data structures,
    or objects are defined, each with its own properties or attributes. Each object can also contain its own procedures or methods.
    Software is designed by using objects that interact with one another.
