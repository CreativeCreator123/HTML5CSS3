<h1><u><b>MOST POPULAR PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES 2021</b></u></h1>

<p>
  Pretty much sure, almost everyone knows that in today’s digitally advanced world how technology is 
  changing at a rapid pace. It has become quite normal to watch alternative technologies surpassing
  each other frequently with regular updates & advancements. Amidst all this, there comes a domain that
  gets affected a lot with such a volatile nature of the tech world –<em> and that is Programming Language!</em><br>
  <br>
  Knowing a programming language is essential for many high-tech jobs, such as those in the fields of
  data science and software engineering. A question people often ask when considering a new career 
  that involves technology is “which programming language(s) should I learn?”<br>
<br>

<em><strong style=font-size:180%; >So here comes the big 10.</strong></em><br>
</p>
<br>
<h3><u>1.Javascript</u></h3>
<p>
  <img src="/Coding images/Javascript.png" alt="JavaScript">
  <!-- JavaScript is a programming language commonly used in web development. It was originally developed 
  by Netscape as a means to add dynamic and interactive elements to websites. Many languages came and 
  disappear but JavaScript is one of those few renowned languages that is enjoying a high run and demand
  in the programming world. Though the language is primarily known for adding responsive elements on 
  web pages it has a wide range of applications such as in web development, game development, mobile 
  application development, and many more. Plus JavaScript is primarily a front-end language run on the
  browser, it can also be used on the server-side through Node.js to build scalable network 
  applications. Node.js is compatible with <em>Linux</em>,<em> SunOS</em>, <em>Mac OS X</em>, and <em>Windows</em><br>
  <br>
  Along with <u><em>HTML</em></u> and <u><em>CSS</em></u>, JavaScript is essential to front-end web development. <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, some of the renowned companies in the tech world that are using JavaScript are <em>Facebook</em>,
  <em>Google</em>,<em>Microsoft</em>, <em>Uber</em>, etc.<br>
  <br>
  It’s impossible to be a software developer these days without using JavaScript in some way. According
  to Stack Overflow's 2020 Developer Survey, JavaScript is the most popular language among developers
  for the eighth year in a row. Nearly 70 percent of survey respondents reported that they had used 
  JavaScript in the past year.<br>
  <br>
  As there are millions of websites already existing over the web that are heavily relying on JavaScript
  and on top of that, looking at the demand & dominance of the language, it won’t be wrong to say that
  JavaScript will rule in 2021 as well!<br>

<h3><u>2.Python</u></h3>
<img src="/Coding images/Python.jpeg" alt="Python">
<p>Python is perhaps the most <em>user-friendly</em> programming language of any on this list. It’s often said
  that Python’s syntax is clear, intuitive, and almost English-like, which, like Java, makes it a 
  popular choice for beginners. As per the RedMonk Ranking report for the year 2020, <strong>Python outranks 
  JAVA</strong> (Its greatest competitor) to become the second most popular programming language. The language 
  has experienced tremendous growth of around 18-19% in the last 5 years.<br>
  <br>
  The language is extensively used for web development, software development, etc., and with several 
  trending technologies such as Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, Data Science, etc. The 
  language offers some enriching features such as rich library support, automatic garbage collection, 
  easier integration with other languages, GUI Programming support, and many more.<br>
  <br>
  Also like Java, Python has a variety of applications that make it a versatile, powerful option when 
  choosing the best programming language for your use case.  If you’re interested in back-end web 
  development, for example, then the open-source Django framework, written in Python, is popular, easy 
  to learn, and feature-rich.<br>
  <br>
</p>

<h3><u>3.Java</u></h3>
<img src="/Coding images/Java.png" alt="Java">
<p>
Many times it seems out that JAVA is losing its charm but when we look at the actual stats – every year 
JAVA ends up with a really good ranking that proves the particular language is still doing well and 
in-demand in the tech world. There are around 8 million JAVA developers across the world – maybe this 
number can help you to assess the demand & popularity of this particular language.<br>
<br>
Java’s popularity is for good reason; this language is relatively easy to learn and use, boasts 
incredible security and can handle massive amounts of data. These features make Java an ideal language 
for the online finance sector, and it is often applied in industries such as banking, billing and the 
stock market. <br>
<br>
The versatility of the language, however, is what learners find really appealing. Touted as a 
“write-once, run-anywhere” language, Java can effectively run on any operating system, regardless of 
which OS was used to write the original code. It is thus ideal for writing apps not only for mobile 
phones and computers, but also remote processors, sensors and a variety of other consumer products.<br>
<br>

<h3><u>4.C/C++</u></h3>
<img src="/Coding images/C language.png" alt="C language">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<img src="/Coding images/C++ programming.png" alt="C++">
<P>
  As we know both C and C++ are programming languages and used for application development. The main 
  difference between both these languages is C is a procedural programming language and does not support 
  classes and objects, while C++ is a combination of both procedural and object-oriented programming 
  languages.<br>
  <br>
  Both C and C++ are occupying a considerable portion of the tech world and currently ranking at the 
  top positions on various indexes.<br>
 <br>
  There are numerous big tech companies that hire C/C++ developers with some decent salary packages such
  as Adobe, Oracle, Microsoft, Nvidia, etc. And to learn C/C++ in 2021 is not only beneficial from the
  career perspectives but it also somehow makes it easier for you to learn other programming languages 
  afterward.  On the other hand, C++ is an object-oriented programming language (primarily developed as 
  an extension of C). The language is widely used in Game Development, GUI & Desktop applications, and 
  Competitive Programming along with several other fields.<br>
  <br>
  If we particularly talk about C language, the general-purpose procedural programming language is 
  majorly used in the development of low-level systems like operating systems, kernel development, and 
  others. And many other programming languages inherit the properties of this particular language.<br>
  <br>

<h3><u>5.PHP</u></h3>
<img src="/Coding images/PHP.png" alt="PHP">
<p>
  Like many others, if you’re also considering that PHP is not worth it to learn in 2021 then you must
  know that the language is still doing very well in the tech world and is being preferred by the 
  developers. The open-source server-side scripting language is used for the website development and 
  comes up with some prominent features like cross-platform compatibility, object-oriented programming 
  features, easy integration with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc., huge community support, and many more. 
  The language is strongly recommended to beginners as it is quite easier to learn. Some of the popular 
  PHP frameworks that you can take into consideration are Laravel, Symfony, CodeIgniter, etc. So, if 
  you’re particularly looking forward to getting into the web development domain, PHP would be a great 
  choice for you!
</p>

<h3><u>6.Rust</u></h3>
<img src="/Coding images/Rust language..png" alt="Rust">
<p>Rust is a bit of an upstart among the other languages on this list, but that doesn’t mean it’s not a 
  valuable language to learn. Stack Overflow’s 2020 Developer Survey found that Rust was the most loved 
  programming language among developers for the fifth year in a row, with 86.1 percent of Rust developers 
  saying that they want to continue working with it. The advantages of Rust mean that other big tech 
  companies, such as Dropbox and Coursera, are already starting to use it internally. 
</p>

<h3><u>7.Ruby</u></h3>
<img src="/Coding images/Ruby.jpeg" alt="Ruby">
<p>
  Ruby is another scripting language that’s commonly used for web development. In particular, it’s 
  used as the basis for the popular Ruby on Rails web application framework. In addition to the active 
  community and its straightforward syntax, Ruby is also a good language to pick up thanks to its 
  association with great tech businesses. <br>
<br>
 <em>Twitter</em>,<em> Airbnb</em>,<em> Bloomberg</em>, <em> Shopify</em> and countless other startups have all built their websites using
  Ruby on Rails at some point. Beginners often gravitate toward Ruby because it has a reputation for
  having one of the friendliest and most helpful user communities. The Ruby community even has an 
  unofficial saying, “Matz is nice and so we are nice,” encouraging members to model their kind and 
  considerate behavior on Ruby’s chief inventor Yukihiro Matsumoto.<br>
</p>

<h3><u>8.Swift</u></h3>
<img src="/Coding images/Swift.png" alt="Swift">
<p>
  If you’re interested in <em>Apple products</em> and <em>Mobile app development</em>, Swift is a good place to start. 
  First announced by Apple in 2014, Swift is a relatively new programming language used to develop iOS and
  macOS applications.<br>
<br>
  Swift has been optimized for performance and built from the ground up to match the realities of 
  modern iOS development. Not only does iOS run on every iPhone and iPad, but it’s also the basis for 
  other operating systems such as watchOS (for Apple Watches) and tvOS (for Apple TVs). In addition, 
  Apple isn't going anywhere as a tech industry leader, and iOS apps continue to be the most profitable
  in the mobile app marketplace.<br>
</p>

<h3><u>9.Elm</u></h3>
<img src="/Coding images/Elm language.png" alt="Elm">
<p>
One of the youngest languages on our list, what began as a Harvard student’s thesis has now grown to 
become a point of passion for front-end developers around the world.<br>
<br>
Elm compiles to JavaScript, making it ideal for building fast-executing UIs with zero errors at runtime.
Elm is a functional programming language, allowing developers to create client-side interfaces without 
the declarative trappings of HTML and CSS.<br>
<br>
Furthermore, the Elm web architecture was the intellectual inspiration for Redux, the state-management 
library taught here at Fullstack.<br>
<br>
</p>

<h3><u>10.C#</u></h3>
<p>
  For the last many years, C# is holding a good position in the list of top programming languages of 
  almost every index. The general-purpose programming language is developed by Microsoft primarily for 
  its .Net framework. The language is extensively used for game development along with the development 
  of Windows applications, server-side applications, etc. Moreover, C# comes up with a rich set of 
  libraries that makes it a faster and efficient programming language. Some of the remarkable features 
  of the language that are often appreciated by the developers are – structured language, faster 
  compilation, updateable & scalable, component-oriented, complete integration with .NET library, and 
  many more.  <br>
  <br>
  The language is being used in Unity game engine software consistently by the developers and companies
  like Intellectsoft, Capgemini, etc. are also using C# for the businesses – it signifies that job 
  opportunities for C# developers in the market are also satisfactory. So, if you’re looking forward to 
  learning C# in 2021, you can go for it without giving a second thought!<br>
