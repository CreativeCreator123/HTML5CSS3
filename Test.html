<h1>tests</h1>


<p>

A test is an examination used to see whether something has been understood. 
This is very common in schools, workstations and very many other places.
Unknown to many, they are very important and come in handy in certain situations

<h2>Types of tests</h2>

<h3>1. Diagnostic tests.</h3>

<p>

        This testing is used to “diagnose” what a student knows and does not know. Diagnostic 
        testing typically happens at the start of a new phase of education,<br> like when students will 
        start learning a new unit.The test covers topics students will be taught in the upcoming lessons.<br>
<br>
        Teachers use diagnostic testing information to guide what and how they teach.
        For example, they will plan to spend more time on the skills that students <br> struggled with most
        on the diagnostic test. If students did particularly well on a given section, on the other hand,
        they may cover that content <br>more quickly in class. Students are not expected to have mastered
        all the information in a diagnostic test. <br>
<br>
        Diagnostic testing can be a helpful tool for parents. The feedback my kids receive on 
        these tests lets me know what kind of content they will be focusing<br> on in class and lets me
        anticipate which skills or areas they may have trouble with.

<h3>2. Formative tests</h3>

<p>

         This type of testing is used to gauge student learning during the lesson. It is used throughout
         a lecture and designed to give students the opportunity to demonstrate that<br> they have understood
         the material, like in the example of the clock activity mentioned above. This informal, low-stakes
         testing happens in an ongoing manner, and student<br> performance on formative testing tends to get 
         better as a lesson progresses.If you help your children with their homework, you are likely using
         a version of formative testing<br> as you work together.

</p>


<h3>3. Benchmark Testing </h3>

      This testing is used to check whether students have mastered a unit of content. Benchmark testing
      is given during or after a classroom focuses on a section of material,<br> and covers either a part or all
      of the content has been taught up to that time. The assessments are designed to let teachers know
      whether students have understood <br> the material that’s been covered.<br>
<br>
      Unlike diagnostic testing, students are expected to have mastered material on benchmark tests, since 
      they covers what the children have been focusing on in the classroom.<br> Parents will often receive 
      feedback about how their children have grasped each skill assessed on a benchmark test. 



<h3>4. Summative Testing</h3>


This testing is used as a checkpoint at the end of the year or course to assess how much content 
students learned overall. This type of testing is similar to benchmark testing,<br> but instead of only
covering one unit, it cumulatively covers everything students have been spending time on throughout
the year.<br>
<br>
These tests are given — using the same process — to all students in a classroom, school, or state,
so that everyone has an equal opportunity to demonstrate what they know and<br> what they can do. Students
are expected to demonstrate their ability to perform at a level prescribed as the proficiency standard
for the test.<br>
<br>
Since summative tests cover the full range of concepts for a given grade level, they are not able to
assess any one concept deeply. So, the feedback is not nearly as rich or<br> constructive as feedback from 
a diagnostic or formative test. Instead, these tests serve as a final check that students learned what
 was expected of them in a given unit.<br>
